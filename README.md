"Concurrent SHA256 cracking with Kotlin"

This was a school assignment, that gave me the bug for distributed system development
  - And who could forget the polyglot programming fun times? ;) 


I'm going to be refactoring like crazy: 
  - [ ] To remove package-adjacent dependencies
  - [ ] Further clean code
  - [ ] What the heck does "[HttpWorker](https://github.com/stevemasta34/TheEagleHasLanded/blob/master/src/model/worker/HttpWorker.kt)" even do?
    - I don't remember finishing its implementation
  - [ ] Utilize the message queue (for fully "pull-oriented") or scrap it
